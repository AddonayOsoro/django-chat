## Technologies Used

- Backend: Django, Django Channels (for WebSocket support)
- Frontend: React, Redux (for state management)
- WebSockets: Used to achieve real-time communication
- Database: SQLite (for development), PostgreSQL (recommended for production)
- Styling: CSS and/or a CSS framework of your choice (e.g., Bootstrap)

## Configuration

- Backend configuration settings can be found in the `settings.py` file.
- WebSocket routing and consumers are defined in the `routing.py` and `consumers.py` files.

## Deployment

For production deployment, consider the following:

- Set up a production-ready database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- Configure environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., SECRET_KEY, database credentials).
- Use a web server (e.g., Nginx) to serve static files and proxy requests to the backend.
- Set up a domain name and SSL certificate for secure communication.
